1. Pointers Recap
    -> dereferencing
    -> pointers of an array

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation

-> Stack Memory and Heap Memory

-> Dynamic Variable Allocation
    - declaration
    - input
    - output

-> Dynamic Array Allocation
    - declaration
    - input
    - output

-> Why we need Dynamic Array?

-> Problem Solving
