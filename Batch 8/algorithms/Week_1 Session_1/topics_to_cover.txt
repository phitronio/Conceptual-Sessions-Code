-------------------> Types of Graph <-------------------
1. Directed vs Undirected
2. Weighted vs Unweighted
3. Cyclic vs Acyclic
4. Connected vs Disconnected

--------------> Types of graph representation <--------------
1. Adjacency Matrix

2. Adjacency List

3. Edge List


---------------> Pros and Cons Adjacency Matrix <-----------------
1. Pros of Adjacency Matrix
    # Removing any Edge O(1)
    # Checking if there's any edge O(1)
    # Efficient for Dense Graphs (space well utilised)
2. Cons of Adjacency Matrix
    # Space Complexity: O(V²)
    # To find all neighbors of a vertex, you must scan the entire row.

---------------> Pros and Cons Adjacency List <-----------------
1. Pros of Adjacency List
    # Space Efficient (only store existing edges)
    # Easy to find all neighbors of a vertex (just traverse its list)
    # Edge Insertion is O(1) (append to the list)

2. Cons of Adjacency List
    # Checking if there's an edge between two vertices is O(degree)
    # Removing a specific edge is O(degree)

-----------> Space Complexity of Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List <------------
# Adjacency Matrix O(VxV)
# Adjacency List
    O(V+2E) for Undirected Graph
    O(V+E) for Directed Graph
