You are given a 2D matrix representing a maze in a city. Each cell can represent a road, a building, or a destination point. 
You are standing at point S (Start) and want to reach point E (End). You can move up, down, left, and right through road cells, but you cannot pass through buildings.

Your task is to determine whether there exists a path from S to E.
. → road
* → building
S → starting point
E → ending point

2. count how many separate parts of the city exist?(HW-BFS solution)

3. how many cell/road point have in separate parts?(home work)(HW-BFS+DFS solution)
